Problem:
    Given an array and an integer k, where arr[i] is the number of pages of a book and k is total number of students.
    All the books need to be allocated to k students in contiguous manner, with each student getting at least one book.
    The task is to minimize the maximum number of pages allocated to a student.
    If it is not possible to allocate books to all students, return -1.
*/
// Time Complexity: O(n log m), where n is the number of books and m is the maximum number of pages in a book.
// Space Complexity: O(1)

// Input:
// 4 2
// 12 34 67 90

// Output:
// 113
